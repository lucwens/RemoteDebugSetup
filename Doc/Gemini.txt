i want to create a local computer account RD that I can use for remote debugging in visual studio 2026 , so I just want to add the local account to this computer without creating a microsoft account

To set up a local account for remote debugging without linking it to a Microsoft account, you'll need to navigate a few "hidden" links in the Windows 11 interface.

Based on the screenshot you provided, you are already in the right place (Settings > Accounts > Other Users). Follow these steps to create the RD account:

1. Start the Account Creation
Click the Add account button in the Other users section (the one in the middle of your screen).

2. Navigate the "Microsoft Account" Traps
Windows will try to guide you toward a Microsoft email address. Here is how to bypass it:

On the "How will this person sign in?" window, click the small link: I don't have this person's sign-in information.

On the next screen ("Create account"), click the link at the bottom: Add a user without a Microsoft account.

3. Name the Account
In the "Who's going to use this PC?" box, enter RD.

Enter a password (and the required security questions).

Note: For remote debugging, it is highly recommended to use a password; many remote tools will reject connections from accounts with blank passwords for security reasons.

4. Set as Administrator (Required for Debugging)
Once the account appears in your "Other users" list:

Click the dropdown arrow next to the new RD account.

Select Change account type.

Change the "Account type" from Standard User to Administrator and click OK.

Remote Debugging Tip for Visual Studio 2026
Since you are setting this up for remote debugging, ensure that:

Authentication: When you run the Visual Studio Remote Debugger (msvsmon.exe) on this machine, go to Tools > Options and ensure it's set to Windows Authentication.

Matching Credentials: Itâ€™s often easiest if the user account (RD) and password on this remote machine match the credentials you use on your local dev machine, though it's not strictly required if you're prepared to enter them manually when connecting.

Would you like me to show you how to configure the Windows Firewall rules specifically for the Visual Studio 2026 remote debugger?

I tried to mount a shared folder from my own pc from another pc that I control over teamviewer. VPN is active and working and i can ping from both sides. Firewall on my pc has been disabled completely. What is still missing?

It looks like you have established basic network connectivity since your ping requests are succeeding with 0% loss, but Windows is blocking the SMB (file sharing) handshake.

Since the firewall is disabled, the "You do not have permission" error usually points to an authentication or sharing policy mismatch rather than a network block.

1. Check "Password Protected Sharing"
By default, Windows blocks incoming connections from accounts that don't have a password or if the guest policy is restrictive.

On your host PC (the one with the folder), go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Advanced sharing settings.

Under All Networks, ensure Turn off password protected sharing is selected (if you want easy access) or ensure your RD account has a strong password.

2. Match the Local Account Credentials
Windows often struggles with cross-machine permissions if it doesn't recognize the user.

Ensure the RD account you created exists on both machines with the exact same password.

When prompted for credentials on the TeamViewer-controlled PC, try entering them in this format: \IP_ADDRESS\RD (e.g., \7.230.81.240\RD).

3. Verify NTFS & Share Permissions
Being an Administrator isn't enough; the specific folder must be "broadcast" to the network.

Right-click the folder > Properties > Sharing tab > Advanced Sharing.

Check Share this folder, click Permissions, and ensure Everyone (or the RD user) has "Full Control" or "Change/Read."

Go to the Security tab and ensure the RD user is also added there with appropriate permissions.

4. Enable SMB 1.0 (Only if using an older OS)
If the machine you are using over TeamViewer is running an older version of Windows or a specialized industrial OS, it might require SMB 1.0, which is disabled by default in modern Windows 11.

Search for "Turn Windows features on or off".

Look for SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support and check it (though this is a security risk, it is sometimes necessary for legacy remote debugging environments).

5. LAN Manager Authentication Level
Sometimes the VPN creates a mismatch in how passwords are encrypted.

Press Win + R, type secpol.msc.

Navigate to Local Policies > Security Options.

Find Network security: LAN Manager authentication level.

Set it to Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM.

Would you like me to walk you through how to map the drive via the Command Prompt so we can see the specific System Error code (like Error 5 or 53)?

can you make a comprehensive and detailled guide how to set-up remote debugging with visual studio 2026 on the development pc and Windows 10/11 on the test pc with teamviewer running. List all the prerequisites like remote debugger, teamviewer VPN etc and how the test PC can get access to a local shared folder on the development PC. Make the guide as a markdown file

Here is a comprehensive guide to setting up your remote debugging environment. This guide assumes "Visual Studio 2026" operates on the modern Visual Studio architecture (similar to VS 2022/2024) and addresses the specific challenge of routing SMB (file sharing) and debugging traffic over the TeamViewer VPN.

Remote Debugging & File Sharing Guide (VS 2026 + TeamViewer VPN)
This guide covers the configuration of a Development PC (running Visual Studio 2026) and a Test PC (target machine) connected via TeamViewer VPN.

ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
1. Software Requirements
Development PC:

Visual Studio 2026 installed.

TeamViewer (Full Version).

Test PC:

Remote Tools for Visual Studio 2026 installed.

Download from the Microsoft website or copy from Dev PC: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2026\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Remote Debugger.

TeamViewer (Full Version or Host).

2. User Accounts (Crucial for Auth)
To avoid constant "Access Denied" errors, create a synchronized local account on BOTH computers.

Account Name: RD (as you created previously).

Password: Must be identical on both computers.

Privileges: Must be an Administrator on the Test PC to debug elevated processes.

Phase 1: TeamViewer VPN Setup
TeamViewer does not enable VPN by default. You must install the driver on both machines.

Install VPN Driver (Do this on BOTH PCs):

Open TeamViewer.

Go to Settings (Gear Icon) > Advanced > Open advanced settings.

Scroll down to Advanced network settings.

Next to "Install VPN driver", click Install.

Establish the Connection:

On the Dev PC, connect to the Test PC using TeamViewer.

In the TeamViewer toolbar, click Files & Extras > Start VPN.

A dialog will appear showing the VPN IPs. Note the IP of Partner (e.g., 7.230.81.240).

Verify Connectivity:

Open Command Prompt on Dev PC.

Run ping <VPN_IP_OF_TEST_PC>.

If ping works (as seen in your screenshot), proceed to Phase 2.

Phase 2: Enabling File Sharing (SMB) over VPN
Windows blocks File Sharing (Port 445) on "Public" networks by default. TeamViewer VPN adapters are often identified as "Public/Unidentified", which causes the System Error 5 or "Path not found" errors.

Step A: Configure Firewall on Dev PC (to allow Test PC access)
You need to allow the Test PC to pull files from your shared folder.

Open Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings.

Click Inbound Rules > New Rule.

Rule Type: Port.

Protocol/Ports: TCP, Specific local ports: 445.

Action: Allow the connection.

Profile: Check Public, Private, and Domain (TeamViewer VPN is often "Public").

Scope (Crucial for Security):

Go to the Scope tab.

Under "Remote IP address", select These IP addresses > Add.

Add the TeamViewer VPN Subnet: 7.0.0.0/8 (or the specific IP of the Test PC).

Name: Allow SMB for TeamViewer VPN.

Step B: Create the Share on Dev PC
Right-click the folder you want to share > Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing.

Check Share this folder.

Click Permissions. Ensure the local RD user has Read (or Change) permissions.

Important: Go to the Security tab and ensure RD also has NTFS permissions there.

Step C: Mount on Test PC
On the Test PC, open File Explorer.

In the address bar, type: \\<VPN_IP_OF_DEV_PC>\ShareName

Example: \\7.230.x.x\MyDebugShare

If prompted, enter credentials:

User: DevComputerName\RD

Password: (The shared password)

Phase 3: Remote Debugger Configuration (Test PC)
Start the Remote Debugger application on the Test PC as Administrator (Right-click > Run as Administrator).

Go to Tools > Options.

Authentication Mode: Set to Windows Authentication.

Permissions: Click Permissions and ensure the RD user is listed and has Allow Debug rights.

Note the Port: Visual Studio 2026 usually defaults to port 4026 (or 402x depending on the exact version release).

Format: TEST-PC-NAME:4026

Phase 4: Connecting from Visual Studio 2026 (Dev PC)
Open your project in Visual Studio 2026.

Click Debug > Attach to Process (or Ctrl+Alt+P).

Connection Type: Select Remote (Windows authentication).

Connection Target:

Enter the VPN IP of the Test PC and the port.

Format: 7.230.81.240:4026

Note: Using the IP is more reliable than the computer name over TeamViewer VPN.

Press Enter.

You may be prompted for credentials. Enter the RD account credentials.

Select the process you want to debug (e.g., MyApplication.exe) and click Attach.

ðŸ›  Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue	Solution
"The remote computer is not reachable"	
1. Verify ping works.


2. Ensure Port 4026 (TCP) is allowed in the Inbound Firewall of the Test PC. Create a rule similar to the SMB one in Phase 2.

"Access Denied" (File Share)	
1. Ensure Network Discovery is ON for the profile (Public/Private) assigned to the TeamViewer adapter.


2. Force NTLMv2: secpol.msc > Local Policies > Security Options > Network security: LAN Manager authentication level > Send NTLMv2 response only.

"Unable to connect to Microsoft Visual Studio Remote Debugging Monitor"	Visual Studio and the Remote Tools must be the exact same version (e.g., both 2026 Preview 2). Mismatched versions often fail silently or with vague errors.
VPN Disconnects	TeamViewer's free version may time out. Ensure you are using a licensed version or keep the connection active.
